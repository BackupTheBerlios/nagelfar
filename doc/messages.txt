Explanations of some error messages.

"Found constant "x" which is also a variable."

  This is the error for detecting missing $.
  This is also a common source for false errors. Typically with commands
  that use call-by-name, or when using simple variable names.
  For example, this will give such a message: $w configure -anchor w
  If the constant is within quotes no warning is issued so in the example
  above you can get rid of it by doing -anchor "w".

"Could not complete statement."

  A valid end of this statement could not be found. This means that
  a brace, quote or bracket is missing.
  The message may be followed by extra info that can help figure out
  what happened.

"Close brace not aligned with line \u003cl\u003e (\u003ci1\u003e \u003ci2\u003e)"

  It is assumed that a close brace is indented equally to the line
  where its corresponding open brace is (line \u003cl\u003e).
  The open brace's indent level is \u003ci1\u003e and the close brace's \u003ci2\u003e.
  This error may indicate a brace mismatch, an indentation slip
  or just that you have a different indentation style.

"Found non indented close brace that did not end statement. This may
 indicate a brace mismatch."

  A close brace that is not indented should normally end the
  preceeding statement. See also above.

"Close brace first in statement."

  A close brace was seen where a command should start.
  Typically a brace mismatch.
