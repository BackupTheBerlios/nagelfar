SYNTAX DATABASES

The tool uses a file defining what commands are available and how they
are used. This file is typically called syntaxdb.tcl, and is just a Tcl
file defining variables.

Any file called syntaxdb*.tcl in your current directory or in the
directory where Nagelfar is located is detected and possibly used as
default database unless you specify one on the command line.
The search order for default database is:
 syntaxdb.tcl in current directory
 syntaxdb*.tcl in current directory (if more than one it is unspecified which)
 syntaxdb.tcl where Nagelfar is located
 syntaxdb*.tcl where Nagelfar is located

You can select database(s) with the command line switch "-s".

In the GUI, all databases found are listed, and those found where Nagelfar
is located are marked "(app)".

Syntax databases may contain inline comments, so a file generated with
the -header option may be used with -s.


CREATING SYNTAX DATABASES

A syntax database is created by syntaxbuild.tcl which makes
it possible to create customised databases for the interpreter
where your script will run.

For example, if you want to create a database for Tcl8.2:

tclsh82 syntaxbuild.tcl syntaxdb82.tcl
or
tclsh82
% source syntaxbuild.tcl
% buildFile syntaxdb82.tcl
% exit

Then use it:
nagelfar.tcl -s syntaxdb82.tcl \u003ctcl-file\u003e


On Windows it is usually just to double click on syntaxbuild.tcl
and a new syntaxdb.tcl is generated using your installed Tcl version.
