SYNTAX DATABASES

The tool uses a file defining what commands are available and how they
are used. This file is typically called syntaxdb.tcl, and is just a Tcl
file defining variables.

Any file called syntaxdb*.tcl in your current directory or in the
directory where Nagelfar is located are detected and possibly used as
default database unless you specify one on the command line.
The search order for default database is:
 syntaxdb.tcl in current directory
 syntaxdb*.tcl in current directory (if more than one it is unspecified which)
 syntaxdb.tcl where Nagelfar is located
 syntaxdb*.tcl where Nagelfar is located

In the GUI, all databases found are listed, and those found where Nagelfar
is located are marked "(app)".

A syntax database is created by syntaxbuild.tcl which makes
it possible to create customized databases for the interpreter
where your script will run.

For example, if you want to create a database for Tcl8.2:

tclsh82 syntaxbuild.tcl syntaxdb82.tcl
or
tclsh82
% source syntaxbuild.tcl
% buildFile syntaxdb82.tcl
% exit

Then use it:
nagelfar.tcl -s syntaxdb82.tcl <tcl-file>
