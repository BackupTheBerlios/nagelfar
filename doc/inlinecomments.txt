Nagelfar supports having comments inlined to help it check a file.

Whenever \u003cfile\u003e.tcl is checked, any \u003cfile\u003e.syntax is run through
the syntax checker first.  Thus you can put your comments in such
a separate file instead of your source if that is not suitable.

A comment should start with "##nagelfar" to be recognised as special.
The comment must be a valid Tcl list.

<ul>Ignoring messages</ul>

##nagelfar ignore ?string?
##nagelfar filter ?string?

These two are equivalent and adds a message filter rule for the line
following it. The string argument will be part of the filter pattern,
which is a glob pattern built like this: "*Line *$line:*$string*"
If the string is preceeded by "N", "W" or "E", anything from that
severity level and down is ignored.

Examples:
##nagelfar ignore 
set apa [Miffo a b c]
##nagelfar ignore Unknown variable
set apa [lindex $Gurka 1]
##nagelfar ignore Expr without braces
set apa [expr 1 + 2]
##nagelfar ignore N

Nagelfar also recognises "# PRAGMA: nocheck", which is equivalent to
"##nagelfar ignore", and ignores messages on the next line.

<ul>Specifying variables</ul>

##nagelfar variable name ?type?

This will make "name" a known variable and optionally set its type.
Types are still experimental in Nagelfar. The type "varName" can
be used to tell Nagelfar that a variable contains a variable name,
which suppresses some warnings.

Example:
##nagelfar variable apaName varName
set hejsan [set $apaName]

<ul>Syntax database</ul>

##nagelfar syntax cmd tokens
##nagelfar subcmd cmd subcmds
##nagelfar subcmd+ cmd subcmds
##nagelfar option cmd options
##nagelfar return cmd type
##nagelfar copy from to

All these provides access directly into the syntax database that
usually is loaded from syntaxdb.tcl.
Check syntaxbuild.tcl for more info.

Examples:
##nagelfar syntax binary s x*
##nagelfar subcmd binary format scan
##nagelfar syntax binary\\ scan x x n n*
##nagelfar syntax fcopy x x p*
##nagelfar option fcopy -size -command

Add to subcmd list, e.g. when using namespace ensemble:
##nagelfar subcmd+ string mysubcmd
##nagelfar syntax string\ mysubcmd x x

Copy syntax from command
##nagelfar copy binary mybinary

For more examples, use the database browser to see how the comments
would look like for the commands known in the database.
