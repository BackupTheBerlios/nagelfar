 Added support in syntax database for expressing different
 definitions for different number of arguments.

 Added support to mix options that are followed by a value and
 options that don't.

 Detect shortened options, just like shortened subcommands.
  
 Separate checks for expressions that need braces and those who don't.
 Those who need it are always checked regardless of the check-braced-expr
 option.
